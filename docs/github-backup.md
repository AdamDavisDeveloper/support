You can automatically backup your published posts as markdown files to a public or private repository on GitHub. Backups are also updated automatically upon any edit or delete change.

Here is how to set up automatic GitHub backups on your blog:

1. Create a [new repository](https://github.new/) on GitHub to store your articles, probably named **hashnode-backups** or **articles**.

2. Log in to your Hashnode account.

3. Click on your **profile picture** at the bottom-left corner of the page on *desktop* screen or top-right corner on *mobile* screen.

5. Click on the **BACKUPS** tab and click the **Hashnode GitHub App** link provided to install the Hashnode GitHub App in the repository you created. (Kindly select just one repository and not "All repositories").
