## How can I save a draft on Hashnode?

You don't need to save a draft because it's already saved automatically for you when you start writing.

## What's a Markdown format?

Markdown is a lightweight plaintext markup language that you can use to add elements to plaintext documents rather than using the older WYSIWYG editor. Hashnode's editor supports the Markdown syntax and allows you to format your articles easily.

## What's an Impressum?

Impressum is a legal statement of ownership and authorship added to your blog to protect user data, combat illegal content and spam. It is legally required on all commercial websites published in German-speaking countries. [Learn more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressum).

## How can I add a table in a blog post?

Use the markdown format below to add a table in your blog post.

```
| I |HI |Hey|
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
```

## How can I set a canonical URL?

A canonical tag is a unique HTML element with a unique URL that helps search engines prevent duplicate content issues in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) by specifying the **canonical** or **most preferred** or **original source** version of a web page.

When you create a blog with Hashnode and map a custom domain, you already have total independence over your blog and canonical. What you need to do is to update the canonical URL of your posts on other platforms you have published on in the past.

## Why is tagging a post important?

Tagging a post is crucial because it will make your post appear on your target audience feed (who follow the same tags), which increases your readership and clicks to your website when your blog post is shared on any social media platform.

## How can I start an [AMA Session](https://hashnode.com/amas) on Hashnode?

You cannot start an AMA session on Hashnode yourself because it is an invite-only program managed by the Hashnode team. If you would love to get featured as a guest, send an email to [hello@hashnode.com](mailto:hello@hashnode.com).

## How can I change my display name, tagline, bio, tech stack, and more?

Go to [https://hashnode.com/settings](https://hashnode.com/settings) and make any changes as required.

## Where can I find Hashnode's privacy policy and terms of service?

This is our [Privacy policy](https://hashnode.com/privacy) and [Terms of service](https://hashnode.com/terms).

## Why am I banned on Hashnode?
