With our Static Pages feature, you can create extra pages and routes (e.g., **/about**) for your blog.

Your created static pages will also appear on your blog's navigation bar, and the content of the pages is written entirely in markdown. Check out our markdown guidelines [here](markdown-guidelines.md).
